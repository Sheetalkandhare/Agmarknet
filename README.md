There are over 4,000 agriculture markets (commonly known as mandis) in the country. Everyday prices fluctuate in the markets basis supply and demand of the crop.  Prediction of crop prices is one of the most important task to ensure efficient crop planning and food safety in the country.  The problem statement revolves around prediction of prices for the crop Potato in District “Agra” in the state of Uttar Pradesh across year 2020.
Data:

i. The historical data for prices in district “Agra” of state “Uttar Pradesh” are reported daily on Agmarknet.

ii. Prices for a particular date (say 20 Mar’2021) can be extracted from a URL on Agmarknet:

Description:
====================================================================================================================================
Following are the tasks which need to be done:

a.	Write a python script to fetch data of prices for the year 2020 (date wise from 1st Jan’2020 to 31st Dec’2020) for district “Agra” of Uttar Pradesh from the data sources mentioned in the data section (can take point b as a reference). Following is the output schema expected:
#DATA SET: Agmarket_assg.csv#
It consists of 3 parts:
